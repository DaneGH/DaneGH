    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Greetings! My name is John Pork, I'm a resident of the United Kingdom and am 34 years of age. Until recently I worked as a brick layer, then crypto hit and I was able to leave 
        my boring job behind and begin a life of adventure. As you will find on this website, I love travelling and am excited to share some of my adventures with
        you!
    </p>

        As you explore my virtual space here you will come to find that I am quite a unique fellow. 
        My adventures around the globe have really allowed me to explore and learn new things about myself. I hope that at least some of what I present
        on this website will leave a lasting impression. 
    </p>

        I also love playing games and making music, it is one of my favorite things to do when im at home, and sometimes I take
        a laptop with me when I'm travelling and make some music if I feel bored.
    </p>
