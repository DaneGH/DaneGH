<p>
    Greetings! My name is John Pork, I'm a resident of the United Kingdom and am 34 years of age. Until recently I worked as a brick layer, then crypto hit and I was able to leave 
    my boring job behind and begin a life of adventure. As you will find on this website, I love travelling and am excited to share some of my adventures with
    you!

    This is just a few random facts about myself! As you explore my virtual space here you will come to find that I am quite a unique fellow. 
    My adventures around the globe have really allowed me to explore and learn new things about myself. I hope that at least some of what I present
    on this website will leave a lasting impression.

    a laptop with me when I'm travelling and make some music if I feel bored.
