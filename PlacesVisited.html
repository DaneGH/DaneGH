    I have been to many places on the planet but the first one I will discuss was my trip to France! This was actually my first trip I took after coming upon finacial freedom, and it really stood out to me. The people, the food, the buildings, all of it 
    provided some sense of beauty. If you ever find yourself wondering where to travel and you're a novice then I would 100% consider checking out France! Pictured below is the 
    Eiffel Tower, one of the landmarks that stood out to me during my visit and provided a lovely view.
