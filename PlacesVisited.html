        I have been to many places on the planet but the first one I will discuss was my trip to France! This was actually my first trip I took after coming upon finacial freedom, and it really stood out to me. The people, the food, the buildings, all of it 
        provided some sense of beauty. If you ever find yourself wondering where to travel and you're a novice then I would 100% consider checking out France! Pictured below is the 
        Eiffel Tower, one of the landmarks that stood out to me and a staple of French culture.

        "In New York, Concrete jungle where dreams are made of" You guessed it! New York, or as I like to call it New Pork. You can't say you've traveled 
        unless you've visited New York. Such an amazing busy place, filled with all kinds of people. My favorite tourist spot was the statue
        of liberty, if you are ever here make sure to check it out!
