    <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my travel tips page where I will be sharing some tips that I think are important when beginning your adventure around
        the globe. Take it from an expert I know what I am doing and am glad I have this platform to share tips with you. The first tip is an important one
        and it pertains to where you travel. You want to pack according to your location. If you were to example pack shorts for a trip to Canada during
        the winter that wouldn't be very intelligent. Really research the area and find what you may or may not need. Below is a picture of some of the stuff that 
        I usually take with me.

        My second travel tip that I am passing on to you lovely people is to learn the language of the place you are travelling to unless the citizens their 
        speak your native language. An example of this is when I traveled to France for a bit. I learnt some French so I would be able
        to have conversations with the locals and navigate the area.

    <img 
        src = "TravelImages/French.jpg"
        alt = "Visual of another gentleman speaking French for refrence"
        height = 300
        width = 450

        My final travel tip that I will be sharing, as part of the fun of travelling is learning how to travel, is that of reasarching 
        the popular tourist areas and areas that could pose to be a waste of that all so valuable travel time. Obviously when I was 
        planning my trip to New York I already knew some of the well known hot-spots, but I also searched for some hidden gems that
        I thought could prove and interesting visit. Below is one of the places I didn't know about so decided to include in my Travel
        itinerary

        src = "TravelImages/HudsonYardsVessel.jpg"
        alt = "Hudson Yards Vessel"
