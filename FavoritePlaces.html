        I hope you've been enjoying browsing my website so far and that it has proved both entertaining and useful. This page is more
        my thoughts and comments than anything. Speaking on some of the most entertaining places I have visited. Deciding the top three places I 
        have visited is quite a struggle as there are so many amazing places to choose from, but the place that takes the number one spot is without a doubt
        Greece. The views were amazing, the weather was mind-blowingly spectacular. My whole time there was filled with nothing but pleasantries. Definetly
        recommend checking it out sometime if you get the chance.

        Now second up on my list would definetly have to be spain. I mean just look at those buildings, amazing how they were constructed 
        and the sort of satisfying effect it gives off. While this trip was one of the best I did have a few unfortunate altercations 
        with the locals as I was ridiculed for my snout. Did people never learn not to stare. Anyway apart from that it was amazing so I definetly
        recommend it.

        The place that takes the third spot on my list will definetly have to be France. Now im sure reading through this has you thinking, is there 
        a Mrs. Pork in your life? And as of right now there isn't but every year I take a trip to France, Paris specifically, as its known as the city
        of love. I hope to one day settle down but for right now I'm just going day by day till I find that special someone. The food 
        was also nothing to scoff at. Delicious. 
    </p>
